// Window mode's PS VR2 Sense controllers as one gamepad. Outside a Full Space visionOS gives an
// app no controller tracking, but GameController still reports each half's buttons and sticks
// (visionOS 26), so the two halves can play as one pad. From the TPVR port
// (src/dusk/visionos/visionos_sense_pad.mm), which feeds them to SDL as a virtual gamepad.
// The immersive modes read the controllers through the OpenXR provider instead.
