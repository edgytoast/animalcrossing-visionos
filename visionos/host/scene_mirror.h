// The scene mirror's frame builder, for the window mode (GameWindowView.swift, MirrorScene.swift).
//
// The window can't show the game's finished picture with real depth (a picture smears from the
// side), so it draws the game's 3D scene again itself: RealityKit renders the same triangles from
// the viewer's real eyes, with correct depth from any angle. This file is the engine-independent
// half of that, generalised from the TPVR port's (extern/aurora/lib/gx/mirror.cpp): the engine's
// capture hands over each 3D draw already decoded (view-space triangles, one texture, a per-vertex
// colour formula, a material), and this
//   - clips them as the GPU does (near plane; the view's sides with a margin for leaning),
//   - nudges coplanar draws apart in the game's order (RealityKit can't settle depth ties the way
//     a LEQUAL test does), lifts decals a capped amount, drops runaway vertices,
//   - merges solid draws by material and keeps blended runs in the game's order,
//   - on a worker thread: pushes the sky past the level, eases what is nearer than the window's
//     glass into the room the window has in front of it (subdividing first), lifts decals,
//     computes bounds, orders the parts,
//   - keeps the last few finished frames for the window to pair with its own frame (by the game's
//     frame number), and sends each texture once.
//
// What stays the engine's (the capture; see port-build/references/windowed-mode.md):
//   - which draws are the 3D world: between the top of the frame and the end of the 3D pass,
//     perspective, into the main colour target, writing colour, with the scene's projection;
//   - each vertex in the camera's view space (right-handed: camera at the origin looking down -z,
//     +y up), in the game's own units (set_units_per_metre);
//   - the material reduced to "one texture T, colour = T.rgb * mul + add, alpha = T.a * mul.a +
//     add.a, in the game's gamma space", per vertex (lighting and vertex colours folded into mul
//     and add), and the blend/alpha-test/cull/depth state;
//   - each texture as RGBA8, top row first, its id from its decoded pixels (texture_id), never an
//     engine's object id or a decode counter (TPVR's game re-made its texture objects every frame:
//     thousands of "new" textures a minute; a texture decoded again under a new id set the level's
//     material list again, and the window flashed for minutes).
//
// Threads: begin_frame, set_projection, add_draw, add_texture, remove_texture and end_frame on one
// thread (the engine's render or command thread), in that order per frame. acquire on the app's
// main thread (through the bridge). set_enabled from any.
