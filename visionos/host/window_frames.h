// The game's side of the window mode: each finished frame goes to the app (GameWindowView.swift)
// as images in IOSurfaces, and the window paces the game. Engine-independent; generalised from
// the TPVR port's (src/dusk/visionos/visionos_window.cpp, which does the copies with Dawn).
//
// Per frame (begin_frame and claim on the game's thread; the slot's writes, publish or drop may
// happen later on the render thread, as TPVR's did from its render worker):
//   begin_frame()           top of the frame: waits for the window's tick (at most 100 ms),
//                           returns the frame's number (give it to scene_mirror::begin_frame too)
//   claim()                 this frame's slot, or nullptr (the app holds them all: skip the frame)
//   surface(slot, image..)  an image's IOSurface, (re)made at its size; write it on the GPU
//                           (window_frames::metal below, or import it into your API) or the CPU
//   set_camera(slot, ...)   the scene camera, when a 3D scene was drawn
//   publish(slot, ...)      once the writes are submitted, with the MTLSharedEvent they signal
//
// The images, and where in the frame to take them:
//   Base      the 3D world, before the screen effects (bloom, mist, fades, letterbox bars): with
//             the scene mirror, where its frame ends (scene_mirror::end_frame)
//   Scene     the picture just before the HUD/2D pass, effects included,
//   Distance  and its depth buffer as distances (copy_distance)
//   Final     the finished frame, HUD and all (the only one a frame without 3D needs)
//   Ui        an overlay UI the engine draws outside the frame (premultiplied), if any
// The window shows the mirror's 3D, the screen effects as a layer (Scene against Base), and the HUD
// (Final against Scene) flat on its glass.
